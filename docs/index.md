# World Happiness Report: Data Visualization

On this page the visualizations described in the [DataVis report](https://moleseaau.github.io/DataVisExam.pdf) can be found as HTML files. Clicking the links below will open the idiom, where the visualizations interactive elements can be played around with. 

## Tasks

These tasks was constructed before designing the visualizations, and with the support of the idioms, these questions can be answered.

- Which are the happiest countries in the world?
- Can a correlation between the countries region and their happiness score be found?
- What factors seem to contribute toward or explain the countries happiness score?

Furthermore, these adittionaly tasks were defined for the user test, to help get an understanding of the interactive elements in the visualizations.

- What is the average happiness score?
- At what rank does France lie on?

All these tasks should be answerable only using the bar idiom, but support from the bubble and spatial idiom can make these tasks easier.
