# World Happiness Report Data Visualization

On this page the visualizations described in the DataVis report can found as a HTML file. There, the visualizations interactive elements can be played around with. 

## Problem Statements

The constructed visualizations idioms should help with answering the following problem statements

- What are the top 5 happiest countries in the world?
- Can a correlation between the region of the countries and their happiness score be found?
- Do the explanatory variables actually seem to have any influence on the happiness score?


To this page you should add links to your interactive html-maps that are located under your Exercise-5 repository like the following (*modify the username part* + *notice that **e**xercise starts with lower e -letter *):

 `automating-gis-processes.github.io/exercise-5-MyGitHubUserName`

Here is an example how to do it in MarkDown for user HTenkanen:
